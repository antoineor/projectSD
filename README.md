## 🎯 Why?
Squaredice is a game entirely designed and developed by Antoine Oriou and Raphaël Petit in 2024. It originated from the idea that visualization is one of the most crucial cognitive abilities. It serves as the foundation for many types of reasoning involved in solving complex problems, particularly in engineering and scientific fields. The analytical and theoretical understanding of a complex object requires multiple approaches and perspectives, which must be deeply internalized through experimentation.

## 🛠️ How?
With our game, **SQUAREDICE**, we aim to enhance this competence by offering players an infinite landscape for mental mapping. The game fosters an environment that demands extensive use of **spatial cognition** and **multilayered memory**.

This intellectual challenge is further reinforced by a motivational and competitive structure, elevating the player's experience. Our goal aligns with our passion for learning and providing learning opportunities. We are committed to contributing to this domain, which requires individuals to exhibit **critical thinking, systematic examination, and analytical reasoning** within a simple yet dynamic and challenging game.

As the game progresses, its complexity escalates, demanding strategic planning and deep logical thinking. This increasing difficulty allows highly gifted minds to distinguish themselves, creating a **leaderboard** where the most skillful players are ranked.

## 🎮 What?
**Simplicity leading to sophistication through deduction and reasoning.**

### 🕹️ Gameplay
- The game takes place on a **5x5 grid** of squares that can be either **blue or black**.
- The player must reproduce a given pattern on the grid.
- The grid starts fully blue, and the player can toggle square colors using a special tool:
  - Pressing a square flips its color **and** the colors of its **8 adjacent neighbors**.
- Each level has a **limited number of moves** to match the target pattern.
- As levels progress, the required moves increase, making the game exponentially more challenging.

### 🧠 Challenge
- When the pattern requires more than **8 moves**, the game demands advanced **simulative thinking** and **hypothetical deduction**.
- The game ultimately tests and enhances **high-level cognitive skills**.
- The best players will be ranked based on their ability to solve these increasingly complex puzzles.
